TRAIN (TRustless Atomic INtents) Protocol is a trustless and permissionless bridging protocol designed to securely scale across an unlimited number of chains. 

- [Protocol Contracts](https://github.com/trainProtocol/contracts) - A PreHTLC standard with discovery and reward/slash mechanisms.
- [Solver](https://github.com/trainProtocol/solver) -  A comprehensive solver agent supporting a wide range of networks (both EVMs and altVMs).
- [dApp](https://github.com/trainProtocol/app) - The bridging UI dApp, allowing users to complete cross-chain trustless swaps.
- [Station](https://github.com/trainProtocol/station) - The coordinator and aggregator of all TRAIN Solvers â€” aggregates Solvers, executes auctions, and acts as an API for the dApp.

We have completed multiple security audits conducted by top experts in the industry. The reports are available [here](https://github.com/trainProtocol/audits).
